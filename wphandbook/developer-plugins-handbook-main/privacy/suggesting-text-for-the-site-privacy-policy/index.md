Suggesting text for the site privacy policy
-------------------------------------------

Every plugin that collects, uses, or stores user data, or passes it to an external source or third party, should add a section of suggested text to the privacy policy postbox. This is best done with `wp_add_privacy_policy_content( $plugin_name, $policy_text )`. This will allow site administrators to pull that information into their siteâ€™s privacy policy.

To make this simpler for the users, the text should address the questions provided in the default privacy policy:

- What personal data we collect and why we collect it
	- Their own manually input information
	- WP: Contact forms
	- WP: Comments
	- WP: Cookies
	- WP: Third party embeds
	- Analytics
- Who we share your data with
- How long we retain your data
- What rights you have over your data
- Where we send your data
- Your contact information
- How we protect your data
- What data breach procedures we have in place
- What third parties we receive data from
- What automated decision making and/or profiling we do with user data
- Any industry regulatory disclosure requirements

While not all of these questions will be applicable to all plugins, we recommend taking care with the sections on data sharing.

## Code Example

[info]It is recommended to call [`wp_add_privacy_policy_content()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_add_privacy_policy_content/) during the [admin_init](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_init/) action. Calling it outside of an action hook can lead to problems, see ticket [#44142](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44142) for details.[/info]

[info]Supplemental information can be provided through the use of the specialized `.privacy-policy-tutorial` CSS class. Any content contained within HTML elements that have this CSS class applied will be omitted from the clipboard when the section content is copied.[/info]

```
/**
 * Adds a privacy policy statement.
 */
function wporg_add_privacy_policy_content() {
  if ( ! function_exists( 'wp_add_privacy_policy_content' ) ) {
    return;
  }
  $content = '<p class="privacy-policy-tutorial">' . __( 'Some introductory content for the suggested text.', 'text-domain' ) . '</p>'
  . '<strong class="privacy-policy-tutorial">' . __( 'Suggested Text:', 'my_plugin_textdomain' ) . '</strong> '
  . sprintf(
    __( 'When you leave a comment on this site, we send your name, email address, IP address and comment text to example.com. Example.com does not retain your personal data. The example.com privacy policy is <a href="%1$s" target="_blank">here</a>.', 'text-domain' ),
    'https://example.com/privacy-policy'
  );
  wp_add_privacy_policy_content( 'Example Plugin', wp_kses_post( wpautop( $content, false ) ) );
}

add_action( 'admin_init', 'wporg_add_privacy_policy_content' );
