# Filters

**Filters** are one of the two types of [Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/).

They provide a way for functions to modify data during the execution of WordPress Core, plugins, and themes. They are the counterpart to [Actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/).

Unlike [Actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/), filters are meant to work in an isolated manner, and should never have [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)) such as affecting global variables and output. Filters expect to have something returned back to them.

## Add Filter

The process of adding a filter includes two steps.

First, you need to create a Callback function which will be called when the filter is run. Second, you need to add your Callback function to a hook which will perform the calling of the function.

You will use the [`add_filter()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_filter/) function, passing at least two parameters:

1. `string $hook_name` which is the name of the filter youâ€™re hooking to, and
2. `callable $callback` the name of your callback function.

The example below will run when the `the_title` filter is executed.

```
function wporg_filter_title( $title ) {
  return 'The ' . $title . ' was filtered';
}
add_filter( 'the_title', 'wporg_filter_title' );
```

Lets say we have a post title, "Learning WordPress", the above example will modify it to be "The Learning WordPress was filtered".

You can refer to the [Hooks](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/) chapter for a list of available hooks.

As you gain more experience, looking through WordPress Core source code will allow you to find the most appropriate hook.

### Additional Parameters

[`add_filter()`](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_filter/) can accept two additional parameters, `int $priority` for the priority given to the callback function, and `int $accepted_args` for the number of arguments that will be passed to the callback function.

For detailed explanation of these parameters please read the article on [Actions](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/hooks/actions/).

### Example

To add a CSS class to the `<body>` tag when a certain condition is met:

```
function wporg_css_body_class( $classes ) {
  if ( ! is_admin() ) {
    $classes[] = 'wporg-is-awesome';
  }
  return $classes;
}
add_filter( 'body_class', 'wporg_css_body_class' );
```
