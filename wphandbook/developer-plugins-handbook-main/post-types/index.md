WordPress stores the Post Types in the `posts` table allowing developers to register Custom Post Types along the ones that already exist.

This chapter will show you how to [register Custom Post Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/registering-custom-post-types/), how to [retrieve their content from the database, and how to render them to the public](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/post-types/working-with-custom-post-types/).
