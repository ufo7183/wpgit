# Heartbeat API

The Heartbeat API is a simple server polling API built in to WordPress, allowing near-real-time frontend updates.

## How it works

When the page loads, the client-side heartbeat code sets up an interval (called the "tick") to run every 15-120 seconds. When it runs, heartbeat gathers data to send via a jQuery event, then sends this to the server and waits for a response. On the server, an admin-ajax handler takes the passed data, prepares a response, filters the response, then returns the data in JSON format. The client receives this data and fires a final jQuery event to indicate the data has been received.

The basic process for custom Heartbeat events is:

1. Add additional fields to the data to be sent (JS `heartbeat-send` event).
2. Detect sent fields in PHP, and add additional response fields (`heartbeat_received` filter).
3. Process returned data in JS (JS `heartbeat-tick`).

(You can choose to use only one or two of these events, depending on what functionality you need.)

## Using the API

Using the heartbeat API requires two separate pieces of functionality: send and receive callbacks in JavaScript, and a server-side filter to process passed data in PHP.

### Sending Data to the Server

When Heartbeat sends data to the server, you can include custom data. This can be any data you want to send to the server, or a simple true value to indicate you are expecting data.

```
jQuery( document ).on( 'heartbeat-send', function ( event, data ) {
  // Add additional data to Heartbeat data.
  data.myplugin_customfield = 'some_data';
});
```

### Receiving and Responding on the Server

On the server side, you can then detect this data, and add additional data to the response.

```
/**
 * Receive Heartbeat data and respond.
 *
 * Processes data received via a Heartbeat request, and returns additional data to pass back to the front end.
 *
 * @param array $response Heartbeat response data to pass back to front end.
 * @param array $data     Data received from the front end (unslashed).
 *
 * @return array
 */
function myplugin_receive_heartbeat( array $response, array $data ) {
  // If we didn't receive our data, don't send any back.
  if ( empty( $data['myplugin_customfield'] ) ) {
    return $response;
  }

  // Calculate our data and pass it back. For this example, we'll hash it.
  $received_data = $data['myplugin_customfield'];

  $response['myplugin_customfield_hashed'] = sha1( $received_data );
  return $response;
}
add_filter( 'heartbeat_received', 'myplugin_receive_heartbeat', 10, 2 );
```

Back on the frontend, you can then handle receiving this data back.

```
jQuery( document ).on( 'heartbeat-tick', function ( event, data ) {
  // Check for our data, and use it.
  if ( ! data.myplugin_customfield_hashed ) {
    return;
  }

  alert( 'The hash is ' + data.myplugin_customfield_hashed );
});
```

Not every feature will need all three of these steps. For example, if you donâ€™t need to send any data to the server, you can use just the latter two steps.
