# Administration Menus

Administration Menus are the interfaces displayed in WordPress Administration. They allow you to add option pages for your plugin.

[info]For information on managing Navigation Menus, see the Navigation Menus chapter of the Theme Developer Handbook.[/info]

## Top-Level Menus and Sub-Menus

The Top-level menus are rendered along the left side of the WordPress Administration. Each menu may contain a set of Sub-menus.

When deciding between [Top-level menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/top-level-menus/) and [Sub-menus](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/administration-menus/sub-menus/) think carefully about the needs of your plugin as well as the needs of your end users.

[alert]We recommend developers with a single option page to add it as Sub-menu to one of the existing Top-level menus; such as Settings or Tools.[/alert]
