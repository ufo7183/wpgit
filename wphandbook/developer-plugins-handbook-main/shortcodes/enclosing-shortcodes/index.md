# Enclosing Shortcodes

The are two scenarios for using shortcodes:

- The shortcode is a self-closing tag like we seen in the [Basic Shortcodes](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/shortcodes/basic-shortcodes/) section.
- The shortcode is enclosing content.

## Enclosing Content

Enclosing content with a shortcode allows manipulations on the enclosed content.

```
[wporg]content to manipulate[/wporg]
```

As seen above, all you need to do in order to enclose a section of content is add a beginning `[$tag]` and an end `[/$tag]`, similar to HTML.

## Processing Enclosed Content

Lets get back to our original `[wporg]` shortcode code:

```
function wporg_shortcode( $atts = array(), $content = null ) {
  // do something to $content
  // always return
  return $content;
}
add_shortcode( 'wporg', 'wporg_shortcode' );
```

Looking at the callback function we see that we chose to accept two parameters, `$atts` and `$content`. The `$content` parameter is going to hold our enclosed content. We will talk about `$atts` later.

The default value of `$content` is set to `null` so we can differentiate between a self-closing tag and enclosing tags by using PHP function [`is_null()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-null.php).

The shortcode `[$tag]`, including its content and the end `[/$tag]` will be replaced with the **return value** of the handler function.

[alert]It is the responsibility of the handler function to [secure the output](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/security/securing-output/).[/alert]

## Shortcode-ception

The shortcode parser performs a **single pass** on the content of the post.

This means that if the `$content` parameter of a shortcode handler contains another shortcode, it wonâ€™t be parsed. In this example, `[shortcode]` will not be processed:

```
[wporg]another [shortcode] is included[/wporg]
```

Using shortcodes inside other shortcodes is possible by calling `do_shortcode()` on the **final return value** of the handler function.

```
function wporg_shortcode( $atts = array(), $content = null ) {
  // do something to $content
  // run shortcode parser recursively
  $content = do_shortcode( $content );
  // always return
  return $content;
}
add_shortcode( 'wporg', 'wporg_shortcode' );
```

## Limitations

The shortcode parser is unable to handle mixing of enclosing and non-enclosing forms of the same `[$tag]`.

```
[wporg] non-enclosed content [wporg]enclosed content[/wporg]
```

Instead of being treated as two shortcodes separated by the text "`non-enclosed content`", the parser treats this as a single shortcode enclosing "`non-enclosed content [wporg]enclosed content`".
