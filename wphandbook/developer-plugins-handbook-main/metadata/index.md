Metadata is information about information. In the case of WordPress, it's information associated with posts, users, comments and terms.

Given the many-to-one relationship of metadata in WordPress, your options are fairly limitless. You can have as many meta options as you wish, and you can store just about anything in there.

This chapter will discuss [managing post metadata](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/managing-post-metadata/), [creating custom meta boxes](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/custom-meta-boxes/), and [rendering post metadata](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/metadata/rendering-post-metadata/).
