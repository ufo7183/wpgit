**The Elementor GitHub organization page and all respective repositories are collaborative spaces for web creators, developers, enthusiasts, and users alike to contribute, share ideas, and help shape the future of Elementor in a positive and welcoming way.**

All participants are expected to follow this Code of Conduct without exceptions.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and welcoming environment, we strive to maintain, in all collaborative spaces, an undiscriminatory and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of skill level, ability, disability, socioeconomic status, political inclination, age, appearance, nationality, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or religion.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in any Elementor GitHub space, as well as the consequences of unacceptable behavior.

**We invite all those who participate to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.**

## Guidelines

To ensure everyone has a good, welcoming, and positive experience, we outlined a few rules that should be followed and enforced by all participants.

### Be Respectful and Empathetic

We embrace healthy conversations but don't tolerate behavior that disrespects or discriminates against other contributors or maintainers. Be aware of diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

**Let's make this a safe space for anyone to contribute and share ideas.**

### Be Welcoming and Open-minded

Our spaces are open for contributors with any experience level. Be receptive to other ideas or points of view and welcoming to all contributors, especially those who are inexperienced.

### Be Constructive, Relevant and keep the conversation On-topic

Criticize ideas, not people.
<br>Explain your thoughts and keep discussions relevant to Elementor products. We don't engage in talks about politics, religion, or other unrelated topics.

**Heated, offensive, and off-topic discussions will be removed at our discretion without warning or requiring any explanation.**

### Keep it tidy

Organize and submit your issues, discussions, and comments correctly:

-   **Always follow** our [Contribution Guidelines](https://elemn.to/gh-contributing).
-   Submit [Issues](https://elemn.to/gh-issues) **only to report bugs.**
-   Submit [Feature Request Discussions](https://elemn.to/gh-feature-requests) **only to request features.**
-   Don't use any space to request support or to file complaints. <br>**Use the official Elementor support channels** instead.
-   **Search before submitting** new threads to avoid duplicates.
-   **Troubleshoot** your issues before submitting a bug report.
-   **Provide instant and thorough information** when requested.
-   **Stay on topic** when commenting.
-   **Don't use other issues or discussions to report different bugs or feature requests.** <br>Instead, submit new ones or join the ones that are already open.
-   Avoid commenting _"+1"_ or _"Agreed,"_ **use the upvote button** when available.

## Expected behaviors

We're here to create a positive and welcoming environment.
<br>Always be respectful, show empathy, respect differing opinions, give and accept feedback gracefully, apologize for mistakes, and focus on keeping all spaces welcoming for all contributors by following our Guidelines above.

## Unacceptable behaviors

Please avoid inappropriate behavior, including using offensive or sexualized language, trolling, harassment, discrimination, disclosing private information without permission, spam or off-topic discussions, and posting complaints about the Elementor company or other subjects.

## Enforcement

Our maintainers will enforce these guidelines and take fair action if necessary.

We reserve the right to close, lock, or remove any thread or comment at any time without warning or explanation. Continuing inappropriate behavior will result in a permanent ban at our discretion.

**This Code of Conduct applies to all Elementor GitHub pages and spaces, including but not limited to Issues and Discussions.**

If you wish to file a complaint, please [reach out to Elementor Support](https://elemn.to/contact).
